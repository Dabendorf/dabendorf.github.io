            <h2>About me</h2>
            I am a computer scientist, based in Bergen, Norway. I studied computer science in Berlin and Bergen.


            <h2>My projects</h2>
            Independent from quality, I upload all of my projects from both university and free time on GitHub. Each project is licensed by the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.de.html">GNU General Public License v2.0</a>. You are welcome to reuse all of my projects for your own work, as long as you state the original author and publish your project under the same license.<br>
            The following list is a very short overview over projects I would like to share with you.

            <h2>Technical interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am backend programmer and hate any contact with frontend work. I mainly programme with Python and Java, I also enjoy the practically useless language of Haskell.</li>
                <li>I regularly work with databases and was teaching assistant in database courses over several years.</li>
                <li>I enjoy algorithms and datastructures and am interest in graph networks.</li>
                <li>I personally enjoy data science and exploring interesting datasets. By the way, Pandas is a terrible framework. I worked a lot with machine learning but wouldn't consider myself being an efficient user.</li>
                <li>I don't use Microsoft products. Long live Open Source products.</li>
                <li><b>I cannot fix your printer.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
            I speak a couple of languages in a range between catastrophic and fluent. I am not sure yet if I enjoy learning languages, but it had some advantages in the past.
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German: Mother language</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ English: Fluent</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Norwegian: Fluent (bergensk!)</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French: Day dependent, between "Bonjour" and fluent</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Dutch: Basics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Til Topps Bergen, Frivillighetsarbeid</h2>
            One of the most amazing projects existing in Norway is the hiking group of <a href="https://www.bergenoghordalandturlag.no/til-topps/">Til Topps</a>. It is a group of volunteers going on hikes around Bergen and Hordaland, taking with us people from other countries wanting to learn Norwegian.
            I once myself learned Norwegian that way and it is a great pleasure, helping people getting better in speaking Norwegian in a stress-free environment (at least if you think hiking is stress-free).<br/>
            If you are interested in becoming a volunteer as well or want to know more about the group, you can visit <a href="https://www.bergenoghordalandturlag.no/til-topps/">our website</a> or send me an e-mail.

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            If there are any questions about some of my projects or anything else, you are welcome to <a href="mailto:contact@dorpapst.de"></a>contact me</a>.
