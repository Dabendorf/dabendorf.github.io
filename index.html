        <p>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ This is me. Myself, my projects and a bit about my interests. It is a purely private representation of
            my Open Source projects which I programmed in my spare time.</p>
        <p>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Dette er meg. Nettsiden skriver litt om meg selv, interessene, frivillighetsarbei og mine prosjekter.
            Nettsiden er fullt privat og gir en oversikt over open source prosjektene mine. Nettsiden er pÃ¥ engelsk.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            I am a computer scientist, based in Bergen, Norway. I studied computer science in Berlin and Bergen.

            <h2>My projects</h2>
            Independent from quality, I upload all of my projects from both university and free time on GitHub. Each
            project is licensed by the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.de.html">GNU General
                Public License v2.0</a>. You are welcome to reuse all of my projects for your own work, as long as you
            state the original author and publish your project under the same license.<br>
            The following list is a very short overview over projects I would like to share with you.

            <h3>Traincoloureur (Python)</h3>
            The aim of this <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/Dabendorf-Traincoloureur">little programme</a> is the
            colourful visualisation of public transport distances in Berlin and Brandenburg. It shows distances from a
            certain station (by default Dabendorf Centralstation) represented by a rainbow scale (customisable). Since
            most European transport companies use the same timetable file format, it is possible to use for other
            European cities as well.

                    alt="Distances of all train-, subway- and busstations in Berlin from Dabendorf station."

            <h3>SameGame (Java)</h3>
            This is <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/Java-SameGame">SameGame</a>, a popular game fron my childhood
            in which you need to try to remove all tiles on a board while collecting most points. You remove the tiles
            by clicking on adjacent tiles with the same colour while tiles fall down and empty columns move to the left.

            <h3>JubileeCalculator (Java)</h3>
            This <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/Java-JubileeCalculator">little programme</a> generates round and
            repdigit jubilees for any input date. It is a jubilee calculator for all sorts of people wanting to
            celebrate their 10 million seconds or 666 weeks jubilee.

            <h3>Beamer-template</h3>
            Holding a lot of presentation at university, I created a LaTeX-template for creating presentations in afashionable way. It comes with all the perks and disadvantages of using LaTeX, but has an automatic table of contents, a clickable navigation bar and a lot of nice fancy LaTeX functions.
            <figure>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            As a student assistant at University in Bergen, I was presenting two crashcourses for students, preparing them for their exams some days later. Both presentations use the named template and are available in their own GitHub repositories.<br/>
            The courses are <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/INF115-Kraesjkurs">INF115 Database systems</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/MNF-Kraesjkurs">MNF130 Discrete Structures</a>.

            <h3>INF237 Algorithm Engineering</h3>
            This is a <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/INF237-AlgoritmeEngineering">collection of solved programming riddles</a> of the <a href="https://open.kattis.com/">Kattis website</a> for competetive programming. It includes riddles solved for the University of Bergen <a href="https://www.uib.no/emne/INF237">INF237 Algorithm Engineering course</a>. The used programming languages are Python, Java and Haskell.

            <h3>INF273 Meta Heuristics</h3>
            This is <a href="https://github.com/Dabendorf/INF273-MetaHeuristikker">project</a> from the University of Bergen <a href="https://www.uib.no/emne/INF273">INF273 Meta heuristics course</a>. The aim is to use optimisation concepts to approach better solutions for a logistics problem. The problem was to minimise costs of transport given a number of trucks, distances, packages, their costs and time constraints.

            <h2>Technical interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am backend programmer and hate any contact with frontend work. I mainly programme with Python and
                    Java, I also enjoy the practically useless language of Haskell.</li>
                <li>I regularly work with databases and was teaching assistant in database courses over several years.
                </li>
                <li>I enjoy algorithms and datastructures and am interest in graph networks.</li>
                <li>I personally enjoy data science and exploring interesting datasets. By the way, Pandas is a terrible
                    framework. I worked a lot with machine learning but wouldn't consider myself being an efficient
                    user.</li>
                <li>I don't use Microsoft products. Long live Open Source products.</li>
                <li><b>I cannot fix your printer.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
            I speak a couple of languages in a range between catastrophic and fluent. I am not sure yet if I enjoy
            learning languages, but it had some advantages in the past.
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German: Mother language</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ English: Fluent</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Norwegian: Fluent (bergensk!)</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French: Day dependent, between "Bonjour" and fluent</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Dutch: Basics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Til Topps Bergen, Frivillighetsarbeid</h2>
            One of the most amazing projects existing in Norway is the hiking group of <a
                href="https://www.bergenoghordalandturlag.no/til-topps/">Til Topps</a>. It is a group of volunteers
            going on hikes around Bergen and Hordaland, taking with us people from other countries wanting to learn
            Norwegian.
            I once myself learned Norwegian that way and it is a great pleasure, helping people getting better in
            speaking Norwegian in a stress-free environment (at least if you think hiking is stress-free).<br />
            If you are interested in becoming a volunteer as well or want to know more about the group, you can visit <a
                href="https://www.bergenoghordalandturlag.no/til-topps/">our website</a> or send me an e-mail.

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            If there are any questions about some of my projects or anything else, you are welcome to <a
                href="mailto:contact@dorpapst.de"></a>contact me</a>.
